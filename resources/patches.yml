enchantmentGatherer: "NBT" # `NBT` uses our cozy NBT-based storage format, `PR47-lore` is another implementation for lore based conversion, `upstream` is upstream's provisional lore based implementation. There is not much difference between the last two implementations
compatibility: false # only has an effect if NBT is used above, if set to true, it will use PR47-lore to read non-converted enchantments and convert them, it is only done once per item, but is relatively slow nonetheless
