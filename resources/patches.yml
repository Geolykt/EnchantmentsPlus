# Specifies the reader / writer for enchantments. They can be divided into two main categories, NBT getters and Lore getters, NBT getters are more stable, however can bork other plugins and are inefficent

# NBT The highly configurable, but laggy NBT getter
# lwNBT The not very configurable, but stable NBT getter
