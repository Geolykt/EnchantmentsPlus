# Specifies the reader / writer for enchantments. They can be divided into two main categories, NBT getters and Lore getters, NBT getters are more stable, however can bork other plugins and are inefficent
# Lore Getters are more efficent, however prone to break with some edge-case plugins. they also have implicit backwards-compatibillity. The also work before 1.16
# NBT The highly configurable, but laggy NBT getter
# lwNBT The not very configurable, but stable NBT getter
# PR47-lore The not very configurable, but stable Lore getter, the name comes from the PR it was introduced first, PR #47
# advLore The higly configurable experimental Lore getter
