# Enchantments+
## Description
Zenchantments is a custom enchantment plugin that adds 70+ new enchantments (it doesn't feel like much, to be honest) to the game, covering a multitude of different uses. These include target-tracing arrows, lumber axes, block-breaking lasers, and much more. These custom enchantments are obtained through the normal enchantment process and act like regular enchantments, capable of being combined and merged. The plugin requires no client-side mods or resource packs. A comprehensive configuration file enables fine-tuning of individual enchantments to tailor them to every server's gameplay. 
<br> While we currently don't add or remove any Enchantments, we will attempt to rebalance them and make them futureproof. In essence, we attempt to make this Fork as stable as possible to support Production-grade Servers.
